#### TraceDraw 2

A tool to inspect, visualize and organize trace logs generated by RPython JIT.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is currently in an extremely early stage. I'm developing functionality in backend as I need in my research, and just for fun when I find time.

First version of TraceDraw is at https://github.com/cderici/trace-draw, which is written in Racket, and it has a nice GUI to interact with.

This version is in Go. It includes a cli tool to interact with. 

```
make && tracedraw2-cli
```

I plan to add in the future an API gateway to serve a rest API for a web frontend.
